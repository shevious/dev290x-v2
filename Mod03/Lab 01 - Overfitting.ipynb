Then move the copy to this folder.\n> - If you did not complete the previous lab, use the sample solution as a starting point.\n> - Add data augmentation as you load the training data - for example by rotating or flipping the images. See the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/transforms.html#transforms-on-pil-image) or [Keras](https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/) documentation for help with this.\n> - Add at least one drop layer to your CNN. See the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#dropout-layers) or [Keras](https://keras.io/layers/core/) documentation for help with this."
