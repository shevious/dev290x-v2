      "source": "# Transfer Learning\nA Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification is made up of multiple layers that extract features, such as edges, corners, etc; and then use a final fully-connected layer to classify objects based on these features. You can visualize this like this:\n\n<table>\n    <tr><td rowspan=2 style='border: 1px solid black;'>&#x21d2;</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;'>Convolutional Layer</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;'>Pooling Layer</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;'>Convolutional Layer</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;'>Pooling Layer</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;'>Fully Connected Layer</td><td rowspan=2 style='border: 1px solid black;'>&#x21d2;</td></tr>\n    <tr><td colspan=4 style='border: 1px solid black; text-align:center;'>Feature Extraction</td><td style='border: 1px solid black; text-align:center;'>Classification</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n*Transfer Learning* is a technique where you can take an existing trained model and re-use its feature extraction layers, replacing its final classification layer with a fully-connected layer trained on your own custom images. With this technique, your model benefits from the feature extraction training that was performed on the base model (which may have been based on a larger training dataset than you have access to) to build a classification model for your own specific set of object classes.\n\nHow does this help? Well, think of it this way. Suppose you take a professional tennis player and a complete beginner, and try to teach them both how to play raquetball. It's reasonable to assume that the professional tennis player will be easier to train, because many of the underlying skills involved in raquetball are already learned. Similarly, a pre-trained CNN model may be easier to train to classify specific set of objects because it's already learned how to identify the features of common objects, such as edges and corners. Fundamentally, a pre-trained model can be a great way to produce an effective classifier even when you have limited data with which to train it.\n\nIn this notebook, we'll see how to implement transfer learning for a classification model using PyTorch.\n\n> **Important**:The base model used in this exercise is large, and training is resource-intensive. Before running the code in this notebook, shut down all other notebooks in this library (In each open notebook other than this one, on the **File** menu, click **Close and Halt**). If you experience and Out-of-Memory (OOM) error when running code in this notebook, shut down this entire library, and then reopen it and open only this notebook.\n\n## Using Transfer Learning to Train a CNN\n\nFirst, we'll import the latest version of PyTorch and prepare to load our training data.\n\n> *Note: The following `pip install` commands install the CPU-based version of PyTorch on Linux, which is appropriate for the Azure Notebooks environment. For instructions on how to install the PyTorch and TorchVision packages on your own system, see https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/*"

We'll use these to create an iterative loader for training data, and a second iterative loader for test data (which we'll use to validate the trained model). The loaders will transform the image data to match the format used to train the original resnet CNN model, and finally convert the image data into *tensors*, which are the core data structure used in PyTorch.\n\nRun the following cell to define the data loaders, and then load the first batch of 32 training images and display them along with their class labels."
