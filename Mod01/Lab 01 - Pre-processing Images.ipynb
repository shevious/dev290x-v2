Specifically, you need to prepare the images to be used as training data for a machine learning model that you will build in later labs.\n\n## Set Up Data Folder Paths\nThe raw data is provided in the **../data/voc** folder. You must process this data and save the processed versions of the image files in the **../data/classification/training** folder, retaining the same structure of subfolders for each category of image."
